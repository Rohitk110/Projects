## Analytical Study of Startups
### Introduction: 
In this project, I explore the dynamics of startup data through extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and apply various clustering and classification techniques to gain meaningful insights into startup trends.

### Project Highlights:
#### Exploratory Data Analysis: Conducted EDA to uncover data patterns and characteristics.
#### Clustering Techniques: Utilized K-means, Agglomerative, and DBSCAN to segment startups.
#### Classification Models: Implemented Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest with a notable accuracy of 92%.

### Dependencies:
Python 3.x
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn

### How to Use:
Install the required libraries.
Run the startup_analysis.py script to perform EDA and classification tasks.
Examine the accuracy and performance metrics in the results directory.

### Outcome: 
The analysis reveals actionable insights into startup characteristics and trends, with a high-accuracy classification model providing valuable predictive power.
