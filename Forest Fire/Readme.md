## Algerian Forest Fire Prediction and Regression Analysis
### Introduction: 
This project aims to predict forest fire occurrences and analyze patterns using various regression techniques. By leveraging historical data, I developed models to forecast fire events with high accuracy.

### Project Highlights:
#### Data Exploration: Conducted EDA using Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize data distribution.
#### Regression Models: Applied Linear, Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net regression models.
#### Accuracy Achieved: Obtained 98% accuracy using R-squared metrics with Linear and Ridge Regression models.

### Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

### How to Use:
1. Install the necessary libraries.
2. Run the forest_fire_prediction.py script for regression analysis.
3. Review the model performance and predictions in the results folder.

### Outcome: 
The project showcases effective predictive modeling for forest fire occurrences, demonstrating high accuracy and providing valuable insights for forest management.
